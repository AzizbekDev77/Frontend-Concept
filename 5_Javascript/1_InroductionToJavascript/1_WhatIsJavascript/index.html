  <h1>What is JavaScript❓</h1>
  <p><i>JavaScript</i>, often abbreviated <i>JS</i>, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of
    the <i>World Wide Web</i>, alongside <i>Html</i> and <i>Css</i>. It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g you might
    have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites -- all of that is built using
    <i>Javascript</i>. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser enivorments as well
    such a <i>Node.js</i> for writing server-side code in <i>Javascript</i>, <i>Electron</i> for writing desktop
    applications, <i>React Native</i> for mobile applications, and so on.
