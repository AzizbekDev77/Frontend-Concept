  <h1>History of Javascript❗</h1>
  <p><i>Javascript</i> was initially created by <i>Brendan Eich</i> of <i>NetScape</i> and was first announced in a
    press release by <i>NetScape</i> in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming: initially, it was named <i>Mocha</i>
    by the creator, which was later renamed <i>LiveScript</i>. In 1996, about a year later after the release,
    <i>NetScape</i> decided to rename it to <i>Javascript</i> with hopes of capitalizing on the <i>Java</i> community
    (although Javascript did not have any relationship with Java) and released <i>NetScape 2.0</i> with the official
    support of <i>Javascript</i>
